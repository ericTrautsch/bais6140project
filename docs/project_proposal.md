Rats: Insight into NYC's Rodent Problem

Eric Trautsch

BAIS:6140 Information Visualization

Fall 2023

**Introduction**

This visualization seeks to show the average New York City (NYC) resident the 'whole' story of the rat problem the city faces. Showing the growth of the rat population over the years, and also focusing on educating on the areas of new York where the problem is the worst. The rat population poses health risks and shows issues with sanitization and a safe living environment.

To do this, it plans to focus on the interconnection of rat sightings, rodent inspections, and restaurant health inspection results. By learning from this data, the project seeks to provide practical instights and explore the historical trend and current impact of rat populations.

**Data**

For my dataset, I focused my search on NYC Open Data, trying to find an interesting metric. If the dataset selected does not provide enough context, I plan to overlay or join this data with other datasets from this source.

The project dataset can be found here: [https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/Rat-Sightings/3q43-55fe](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/Rat-Sightings/3q43-55fe)

| **RESULT**                           | Result of the inspection, including: Active Rat Signs (ARS) - ARS include any of six different signs: 1) fresh tracks, 2) fresh droppings, 3) active burrows, 4) active runways and rub marks, 5) fresh gnawing marks, and 6) live rats. Problem Conditions - Problem conditions include garbage (poor containerization of food waste resulting in the feeding of rats), harborage (clutter and dense vegetation promoting the nesting of rats), and mice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

I do not need to clean up this data. These datasets may be joined and overlayed to provide additional context. Any joining or merging of the data will occur in Tableau editor or python scripts. After working with the datasets more, any preprocessing will occur in Python scripts.

**Big Idea**

This project seeks to empower the NYC public with practical insights around urban rodent populations, including its effects on public health and how this has changed historically in the NYC area.

**Storyboard**

Idea: Introduce public audience to concern of growing urban rat population in NYC, highlight impacts on public health (restaurant inspections) and general environment.

- Display current distribution of rat population/sightings, finding hotspots and areas of focus for inspection
- Provide any maps to correlate rodent populations to environmental factors

_Public health_

- Public health risks associated with rat population, transmission of disease, etc
- Show relationship between rat sighting and health inspection results, highlight food safety

_Historical_

- View historical view of rodent population, compare to current
- Possibly show city initiatives and how they were successful/not successful

_Recommendations_

- Any call to action for NYC public; reporting rodent population and promoting a safer NYC

Encourage further research and development and public health management to control rodent populations.

Will include more maps, including public health, and possibly a trend of rodent population over time.

Interactive dashboard sketch:

Viz attend to address:

- Current state
- Public health concerns
- Historical trends
- Recommendations and suggestions based on previous

**Team Communication Plan**

Since this is an individual project, there is no team communication needed. I plan to review any needed deliverables after class each Tuesday and plan my week that way.
